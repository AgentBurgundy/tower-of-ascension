# Tower of Ascension

![Tower of Ascension Logo](./logo.png)

Tower of Ascension is an ambitious Minecraft mod that adds a 100-level challenge for players to conquer. Each level transports players to a unique dimension with its own biomes, mobs, and resources. Beat the boss of each level to advance to the next dimension and take on progressively tougher challenges.

## Features

- **100 Levels**: Each level is a new dimension with unique biomes and environments.
- **Boss Battles**: Every level has a boss that must be defeated to progress.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Mobs become tougher and more numerous as you ascend.
- **New Gear and Ore**: Each level introduces new materials for crafting better equipment.
- **Immersive Biomes**: Explore beautifully crafted biomes with blueish grass and purpley trees.
