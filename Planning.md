# Tower of Ascension
## The Plan

User creates a portal in overworld to start their journey up the "Tower".

- This portal should be easy to build, like iron blocks or something

The user fights from level to level to some predetermined *cap* like a Level 100 or something.

## The Levels
These should just be dimensions, unique blocks and items to be found. With a short quest line of some kind to beat the main boss and progress.

## Ideas
- Choose a class that only works while in the tower dimensions
- Death should be forgiving
